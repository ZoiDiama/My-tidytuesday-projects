### Week 28 | Global Surface Temperatures
This week's data is sourced from NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4). It consists of global and hemispheric monthly means and zonal annual means, combining land, air, and sea-surface temperature anomalies (Land-Ocean Temperature Index, L-OTI). To visualize this data, I chose a heatmap, providing an intuitive and visually appealing representation of temperature patterns.

### Week29 | GPT detectors
This week's dataset is sourced from the R data package "detectors," which contains predictions from various GPT detectors. These predictions are based on a research paper titled "GPT Detectors Are Biased Against Non-Native English Writers" by Weixin Liang, Mert Yuksekgonul, Yining Mao, Eric Wu, and James Zou, published in CellPress Patterns. The study revealed that these detectors exhibit a bias against non-native English writers, as they tend to misclassify authentic writing from non-native English speakers as AI-generated. To effectively showcase the distributional characteristics of the predictions from GPT detectors and identify biases or patterns within the data, a violin plot was employed. This plot allowed for the comparison of predictions between detectors, shedding light on potential biases or patterns present in the data.

### Week 30 | Scurvy
This week's dataset comes from the medicaldata R package and the Scurvy dataset. The data are based on  James Lind published in 1757  "A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts". Within this study, 12 participants with comparable scurvy severity underwent six distinct therapies. Subsequently, after a six-day period, they were invited to assess the severity of their condition using a 0-3 Likert scale. The graph below showcases the outcomes following the six days of treatment, providing a participant-specific breakdown across each treatment category.
